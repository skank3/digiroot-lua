## Digital Root
A digital root is obtained by adding all digits in a number continually until you're left with a one digit number.

For example, let's say you have the number 12345. To get the digital root:
- Add all digits together. $1+2+3+4+5 = 15$
- Add all the digits of 15 together. $1+5 = 6$

The digital root of 12345 is 6.
